Smart Light Alternate Manager - A Way to Manage Smart Lights like Hue and Lifx

## What is slam?
slam aims to be a command line utility that can be used to manage smart lights
such as the Philips Hue and Lifx lights. This utility will aim to abstract the 
differences between these lights allowing for easy management and configuration.

## What does slam do?
One of the core features that slam will target is the saving and application of
''scenes''. A scene in this context will be a configuration of one or many smart
lights into a certain state. For example, a user could configure a scene for 
their office during bright daylight, another for perhaps evening, and yet
another to match the look and feel of a game.

## Stuff to do
* Be able to communicate with a Philips Hue Bridge
* Be able to communicate with Lifx Bulbs
* Get current status from Hue lights
* Get current status from Lifx lights
* Set Hue light to be a desired brightness and color
* Set Lifx light to be a desired brightness and color
* Save a scene of various smart lights
* Load a scene of various smart lights
